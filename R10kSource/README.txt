Use 'make' to generate the executable file R10K_Simulator.

>>make

The R10K_Simulator accept a parameter of trace file name in the current directory to execute.

>>./R10K_Simulator filename.txt

The result will be output in std::out. By default it will be printed in the terminal. If you want to save it in a file:

>>./R10K_Simulator filename.txt > output.txt

Enjoy it!
